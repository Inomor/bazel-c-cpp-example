# Bazel doesn't have a native understanding of C++ versions. This was
# added for Java in 2021; hopefully it might arrive for C++ someday.

# linux, macos, windows, freebsd, and openbsd.

build:linux --cxxopt='-std=c++17'
build:macos --cxxopt='-std=c++17'
build:windows --cxxopt='-std:c++17' # Note slightly different syntax.

# To run tests that use data files on Windows, you either need to turn
# on use of symlinks on Windows with this setting, or (worse,
# generally) use a Bazel library in your test code to look up test
# file locations.

build:windows --enable_runfiles # requires "developer mode"

# There is also a toolchain selection mechanism suite for
# cross-platform builds or other customizations to the tool chain. Our
# repository does not demonstrate that, but it is worthwhile to review
# the official example:

# https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc/tree/main/examples/custom_toolchain

# Bazel doesn't attempt to be hermetic about the system-provided C
# toolchain by default. You can set the CC environment var to pick a
# different local compiler, and that won't invalidate the cache. To
# get hermetic compiler tooling, use toolchains instead.

# build --repo_env=CC=clang

# work around MacOS C++ debugging bug. A more sophisticated approach
# would use a --config osx on osx and mark this setting build:osx,
# to avoid applying this setting elsewhere.
